## Inspiration

I was tasked with producing a physical project for my Yoga exam to demonstrate what I have learned from the course. I thought making a reminder using an Arduino would be a great idea, as it makes for a good starter project.

## Challenges

The challenges faced while creating this project included connecting the wires to their respective spots and ensuring they remained secure.

## Lessons Learned

I learned the basics of how hardware works and how to print to an LCD screen.

## The Project

Built for a final Yoga exam, this project features an LCD screen powered by an Arduino. The Arduino is programmed to display Yoga reminders, helping users remember to meditate.
