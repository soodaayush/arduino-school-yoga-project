## Inspiration

For my final Yoga exam, I wanted to blend mindfulness with making. Instead of a traditional paper or presentation, I built a physical reminder using an Arduino. This project serves as a practical demonstration of my learning, combining yoga principles with beginner electronics and coding.

## Challenges

- Getting all the jumper wires correctly placed and secured on the breadboard
- Learning how to interface an LCD screen with the Arduino
- Uploading and debugging code using the Arduino IDE

## Lessons Learned

- How to connect and power components on a breadboard
- How to use an LCD screen with an Arduino
- How to write and upload Arduino code
- The basics of electronics and microcontroller programming

## The Project

A simple and meaningful Arduino-based device that reminds users to meditate, created as part of a final Yoga exam.
