## Inspiration

I was tasked with producing a physical project for my Yoga exam to demonstrate what I have learned from the course. I thought making a reminder using an Arduino would be a great idea, as it makes for a good starter project.

## Challenges

The challenges faced while creating this project included connecting the wires to their respective spots and ensuring they remained secure.

## Lessons Learned

I learned the basics of how the Arduino and Breadboard work, the process of printing to an LCD screen, and uploading code from Arduino IDE to the microcontroller.

## The Project

Built for a final Yoga exam, this project features an LCD screen powered by an Arduino. The Arduino is programmed to display Yoga reminders, helping users remember to meditate.
